CS365 - Web Programming
=======================

The Web Programming (CS365) was an introduction to server and client web programming.  The class consisted of some lectures, a lot of in-class exercises and a few programming assignements that required communication to and from a NodeJS server.

The final project was a group project.  My group did a Checkers game.  Users register and login; if there is a spot open in the game they can play, otherwise they are a spectator and can participate in the chat.

The `git` repository for Checkers can be found [here](https://github.com/cohenadair/CS365-Checkers).
