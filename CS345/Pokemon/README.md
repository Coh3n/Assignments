Graded Assignment 1
===================

Write an app (you choose what to have it do).  It needs to have at least the following:

* An Activity
* An alternate layout for landscape mode (have something be arranged differently in it)
* Use SavedInstanceState and/or SharedPreferences - either one is fine, but use it for its intended purpose (saving temporary UI state for SavedInstanceState or saving a limited amount of data permanently in SharedPreferences)
* Use an Intent to start a second activity (not just another instance of the same activity).  Send data to the second activity or receive data back from it, using an Extra.
* Don't just extend something we already did; make it new code.
