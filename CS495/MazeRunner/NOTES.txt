Demo
	- movement controls
	- scoring system
	- each powerup
	- finding the key
	- solving the maze

Programming
	- maze file
	- player-wall-powerup collision detection
		- Maze.cpp line 136
		- isNear* methods called each time the player moves
	- movement
		- glTranslate in the correct x/z direction depending on the players' current angle
	- turning
		- similar to rubix cube side rotation
		- player's angle is slightly increased each frame until the turn is complete
		- glRotate on the player's angle
	- hud
		- boolean flags to display different elements
		- elements are png images (much simpler than trying to draw text with OpenGL)
		- 2D overlay drawing (if asked) GLUtils.cpp line 96
